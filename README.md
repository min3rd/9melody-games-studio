This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Styling rules

- **Tailwind-first:** Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling components and layouts by default.
- **No ad-hoc CSS in components:** Avoid adding one-off CSS rules inside component files; prefer composing Tailwind utilities or extracting small reusable utility classes.
- **Global exceptions:** If you must add a special-case style that Tailwind can't express reasonably (very rare), declare the value as a theme/global token in `app/globals.css` with a clear comment explaining why.
- **Where to add new tokens:** Add new CSS variables under the `:root` block in `app/globals.css` and document the reason for the exception directly above the token.

Following these rules helps keep styles consistent, maintainable, and themeable across the project.
