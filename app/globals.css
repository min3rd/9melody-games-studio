/*
Project Styling Rule (Tailwind-first)

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling UI components and layouts by default.
- Avoid adding one-off CSS rules in component files. Prefer composing Tailwind utilities
  or extracting small reusable classes using Tailwind's `@apply` in a central CSS file.
- If a very special-case style is required that cannot be expressed reasonably with
  Tailwind utilities (rare), declare the exception as a theme/global token here and
  document the reason above the token. Example: `--custom-outline-size: 3px;`

This file contains global theme tokens and helper classes intended for those
project-level exceptions. Keep the list small and documented so styles remain
consistent and maintainable.
