# GitHub Copilot / AI Assistant Instructions for 9melody-games-studio

## Quick summary
- This is a minimal Next.js 13+ (App Router) TypeScript project scaffolded via create-next-app.
- Primary source code is in the `app/` folder (App Router): `layout.tsx`, `page.tsx`, `globals.css`.
- Tailwind CSS is configured through `postcss.config.mjs` and `globals.css` (Tailwind v4 style).

## What an AI helper should know (big picture)
- This repository follows Next.js App Router patterns (routes in `app/`). `layout.tsx` sets global fonts and `page.tsx` is the root page.
- The style system uses Tailwind CSS + global CSS variables (see `app/globals.css`). The project also loads Google fonts using `next/font/google` in `layout.tsx`.
- Metadata for the app root is exported via the `metadata` export in `layout.tsx` (Next 13+ pattern).
- `package.json` contains standard scripts: `dev`, `build`, `start`, `lint`.

## Development & build workflows (explicit commands)
- Start dev server: `npm run dev` (or `pnpm dev`, `yarn dev` depending on the user).
- Build for production (local): `npm run build`.
- Start production server after build: `npm run start`.
- Run linting: `npm run lint` (it uses the `eslint` package directly; see `eslint.config.mjs`).

Notes for the agent: When adding scripts or commands, follow the existing `package.json` conventions and keep notations minimal.

## Project-specific conventions & patterns
- Files under `app/` follow the Next.js App Router. Reusable components should follow stable conventions (e.g., move to `components/` if large or reused).
- No `pages/` API or routing is present — use `app/` routes and colocation.
- Fonts are defined with `next/font/google` and saved as CSS variables so they can be used across app components. Keep this pattern while adding fonts.
- Styling uses Tailwind and custom CSS variables (color tokens in `globals.css`). Keep tokens consistent and avoid re-defining layout-level tokens per-component.

## Cross-component flows and integration points
- App Router: `layout.tsx` wraps every route; `props.children` is the slot for the content of each route.
- Image assets served from `public/`; see `app/page.tsx` for usage of `/next.svg` and `/vercel.svg`.
- Tailwind utility classes are used for layout; do not mix component-level CSS modules unless necessary — prefer Tailwind utilities.

## Files and sections AI agents should edit (and how)
- `app/layout.tsx`: modify metadata or fonts. Avoid changing signature of RootLayout — keep the Server component semantics.
- `app/page.tsx`: main entry page; keep existing sample layout or expand with components.
- `globals.css`: place global variables and Tailwind imports here. Prefer variable-driven theming.
- `next.config.ts` and `eslint.config.mjs`: update only for project-level configuration.

## Testing & CI
- No test framework or CI workflows are present in the repo. If adding test infra, prefer Jest + Testing Library or Vitest and add `test` and `ci` scripts in `package.json`.
- For CI, if adding workflows, target `node: '18.x'` or newer for Next v16+. Ensure `npm ci` and `npm run build` run in the workflow.

## Helpful patterns & examples (use these when generating code)
- Prefer the App Router structure: add a folder `app/routeName/page.tsx` when adding routes.
- Use `next/font/google` for font definitions and export CSS variables as in `layout.tsx`.
- Use `/public` assets via `src="/asset.svg"` inside `next/image`.
- Use `tailwind` utilities in JSX and keep `globals.css` for theming tokens.

## When to ask for human help
- If the change touches deployment (Vercel/other provider), confirm environment variables and build settings with maintainers.
- If adding or modifying TypeScript config, request human confirmation when major compiler options or strictness flags change.

## Short actionable rules for Copilot/Suggested PRs (Do / Don't)
- Do: Follow the `app/` App Router conventions; add routes under `app/`.
- Do: Use Tailwind and global CSS variables for theming and layout.
- Do: Use `next/image` for images stored in `public/`.
- Don't: Add server-side APIs in `pages/api` — this repo uses `app/` routes only.
- Don't: Change runtime Node or Next major versions without approval.

## Helpful file references
- `app/layout.tsx` — root layout, fonts, metadata.
- `app/page.tsx` — example root page.
- `app/globals.css` — tailwind import and root variables.
- `next.config.ts`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `package.json` — project config & scripts.
